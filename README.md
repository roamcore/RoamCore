# RoamCore

RoamCore is an open‑source control platform for vans and off‑grid living spaces. It brings the power of Home Assistant to mobile environments in a calm, simple dashboard that grows with you.

## 🌍 Overview
Mobile builds often end up with great hardware and fragmented software. RoamCore pulls everything into one place so you can see what’s happening, make changes quickly, and build a system that feels engineered rather than improvised.

It’s designed to be friendly for beginners and deep for builders:
- **Simple, intuitive** interface that works out of the box
- **Full control** for advanced users who want to customise and extend

## 🎯 What it enables
From one interface, you can:

- **Monitor power** — battery state, charging, solar input, inverter status
- **Manage connectivity** — LTE/5G, Starlink, Wi‑Fi, VPN access
- **Control essentials** — lighting, heating, pumps, sensors, safety systems
- **Automate routines** — simple “modes” and schedules for daily life
- **Stay informed** — clear status at a glance, with room to go deeper

RoamCore is built to feel calm and dependable for new users while remaining deeply extensible for enthusiasts.

## 🏛 Built on solid foundations
RoamCore is designed to be reliable and upgradeable. The stack is built on:

- **Home Assistant** for automation and user experience
- **OpenWrt** for networking and connectivity
- **Proxmox** for a robust host and updateable services

These foundations keep the system transparent, open, and future‑proof.

## 🧩 Extensible by design
Start with the essentials, then grow into a complete control system. Examples of what you can add:

- **Power**: solar, batteries, charging sources, inverters
- **Water**: tank levels, pumps, leak detection
- **Climate**: heaters, fans, AC, temperature sensors
- **Safety**: gas, smoke, motion, door sensors
- **CCTV**: local recording, remote viewing
- **Navigation & level**: GPS, tilt level, trip insights
- **Remote access**: secure access from anywhere
- **Custom dashboards**: tuned to your specific build

This is one of the strengths of open source: the community can keep expanding what’s possible.

## 👤 Who it’s for
- **Everyday users** who want a reliable system that just works
- **Builders and integrators** who want full control and extensibility
- **Home Assistant enthusiasts** who want a mobile‑first, cohesive platform

## ✅ Beta / MVP direction
The initial release focuses on a reliable core experience:

- A novice‑friendly dashboard that feels premium and intuitive
- Strong networking (local-only to begin with, DIY VPN/Nabu Casa supported of course!)
- Clear power system visibility and control (via Victron)
- A clean upgrade path for advanced users (through an 'advanced mode')

## 🔓 Open source and community‑driven
RoamCore is fully open source. If you care about independence, clarity, and building systems that last, you’re in the right place. Contributors, builders, and curious explorers are all welcome.

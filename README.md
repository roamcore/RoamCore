# RoamCore

RoamCore is an open‑source control platform for vans and off‑grid living spaces. It brings the power of Home Assistant to mobile environments in a calm, simple dashboard that grows with you.

## Why it exists
Mobile builds are full of great hardware, but the software is often fragmented, closed, or hard to trust. RoamCore pulls everything into one place — so you can see what’s happening, make changes quickly, and build a system that feels engineered, not improvised.

## What it enables
From one interface, you can:

- **Monitor power** — battery state, charging, solar input, inverter status
- **Manage connectivity** — LTE/5G, Starlink, Wi‑Fi, VPN access
- **Control essentials** — lighting, heating, pumps, sensors, safety systems
- **Automate routines** — simple “modes” and schedules for daily life
- **Stay informed** — clear status at a glance, with room to go deeper

It’s designed to feel calm and dependable for new users while remaining deeply extensible for builders.

## Built on solid foundations
RoamCore is designed to be reliable and extensible. The stack is built on:

- **Home Assistant** for automation and user experience
- **OpenWrt** for networking and connectivity
- **Proxmox** for a robust host and updateable services

These foundations keep the system transparent, upgradeable, and future‑proof.

## Extensible by design
RoamCore is modular. Start with the essentials and expand over time:

- **Power integrations** (solar, battery systems, charging sources)
- **Networking upgrades** (multi‑WAN, failover, remote access)
- **Sensors and safety** (temperature, gas, leak, motion, cameras)
- **Custom dashboards** tuned to your build

The long‑term goal is a unified platform that can grow from a simple dashboard into a complete control system for power, networking, and automation.

## Beta / MVP direction
The initial release focuses on a reliable core experience:

- A novice‑friendly dashboard that feels premium and intuitive
- Strong networking and remote access
- Clear power system visibility and control
- A clean upgrade path for advanced users

## Open source and community‑driven
RoamCore is fully open source. If you care about independence, clarity, and building systems that last, you’re in the right place. Contributors, builders, and curious explorers are all welcome.

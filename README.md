# RoamCore

RoamCore is an open‑source control platform for vans and off‑grid living spaces. It brings the power of Home Assistant to mobile environments in a clean, simple dashboard that can grow with you.

## What it does
RoamCore helps you monitor and control the core systems of a vehicle or cabin from one place — power, networking, automation, and more — without locking you into proprietary hardware or subscriptions.

## Built on solid foundations
RoamCore is designed to be reliable and extensible. The stack is built on:

- **Home Assistant** for automation and user experience
- **OpenWrt** for networking and connectivity
- **Proxmox** for a robust host and updateable services

## Who it’s for
- **Everyday users** who want a system that works out of the box
- **Builders and integrators** who want full control and extensibility

## Open source and extensible
RoamCore is fully open source and designed to be upgraded over time. Start simple, then expand into a powerful, unified control platform as your setup grows.

## Status
RoamCore is under active development. This repository is the canonical source for documentation and project updates.

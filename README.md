# RoamCore

RoamCore is an open‑source control platform for vans and off‑grid living spaces. It brings the power of Home Assistant to mobile environments in a clean, simple dashboard that can grow with you.

## What it enables
RoamCore gives everyday users reliable visibility and control without needing to learn complex systems. From one interface, you can:

- Monitor **power** (battery state, charging, solar input, inverter status)
- Manage **connectivity** (LTE/5G, Starlink, Wi‑Fi, VPN access)
- Control **core systems** (lighting, heating, pumps, sensors, safety)
- View **status at a glance** and automate routines

It’s designed to feel calm and dependable for new users while remaining deeply extensible for builders.

## Built on solid foundations
RoamCore is designed to be reliable and extensible. The stack is built on:

- **Home Assistant** for automation and user experience
- **OpenWrt** for networking and connectivity
- **Proxmox** for a robust host and updateable services

## Extensible by design
RoamCore is modular. You can start with the essentials and expand over time:

- **Power integrations** (e.g., solar, battery systems)
- **Networking upgrades** (multi‑WAN, failover, remote access)
- **Sensors and safety** (temperature, gas, leak, motion, cameras)
- **Custom automations** and dashboards tailored to your build

The goal is a unified platform that grows with your setup — from a simple dashboard to a complete control system.

## Beta / MVP direction
The initial release focuses on a reliable core experience:

- A novice‑friendly dashboard
- Strong networking and remote access
- Power system visibility and control
- A clean upgrade path for advanced users

## Open source and transparent
RoamCore is fully open source. This repository is the canonical source for documentation and project updates.
